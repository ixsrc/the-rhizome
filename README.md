## Problem This Solves
One of the major issues of chan- and Reddit-esque formats is ephemerality: an insightful post or comment pops up, you learn a lot from it, and then you can never find it again. Optimally the best posts would be in a nice concise format for easy reference and signal boosting.

## The Solution
As a solution to ephimerality, this is a way to ‚Äúcanonize‚Äù a post under some topic. Say you encounter a meme that notes the US media's hipocrisy in its coverage of the 2022 Russo-Ukraine Crisis and think it would be helpful for others to see:

You can easily drag and drop it into a new note in this structure, and then attach it to the topics and people referenced:

With enough interest in a topic, its note will contain a collection of memes, posts, articles, etc. and would be a great base for coherent and consistent messaging. Imagine just having to look up the topic and finding a collection of ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what works to convince your friends!‚Äù
